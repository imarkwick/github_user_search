#Github user search

This week was javascript and SPA week at Makers Academy, with this project focussing on Angular and APIs.

We were told to create a program that makes a mini report card using info from [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/).

My pair decided to make a teacher's report card that shows the number of commits for each repo used on the Makers course, made by the user (or teacher) searched for. 

To run the tests use;

```sh
$ karma start test/karma.conf.js
```

To open in the browser;

```sh
$ open index.html
```
