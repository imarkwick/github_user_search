# Github user search

This week we were introduced to javascript and SPAs at Makers Academy, with this project focussing on AngularJS and APIs.

## Objective

To create a program that makes a mini report card using info from [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/).

My pair decided to make a teacher's report card that shows the number of commits for each repo used on the Makers course, made by the user (or teacher) searched for. 

## Technologies used:

* AngularJS
* Javascript
* HTML5
* CSS
* Karma
* Jasmine
* jQuery
* Mustache
* GitHub api

## How to run tests:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/imarkwick/github_user_search.git
$ cd github_user_search
$ bower install
$ karma start test/karma.conf.js
```

## How to open in the browser:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/imarkwick/github_user_search.git
$ cd github_user_search
$ open index.html
```
